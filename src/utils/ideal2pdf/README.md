# ideal2pdf

## Overview

ideal2pdf is a tool to visualize the C2 Ideal intermediate representation. The
tool works as a complement to the interactive IdealGraphVisualizer, parsing
graph files generated by the JVM and drawing each graph into a separate PDF
file.

## Dependencies

ideal2pdf has the following dependencies:

- Python ≥ 3.8
- Graphviz ≥ 2.43

### Installation on Ubuntu 20.04

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pygraphviz python3-matplotlib graphviz
```

## Usage

To draw each graph from an XML graph file `foo.xml`, run:

```
./ideal2pdf foo.xml
```

To list the id, method, and compiler phase of each graph, run:

```
./ideal2pdf foo.xml --list
```

By default, `ideal2pdf` draws all graphs in the XML graph file, including all
nodes in each graph. To select only a graph with id `i`, method `m`, and
compiler phase `p`, run:

```
./ideal2pdf foo.xml --filter "g == i and method(g) == 'm' and phase(g) == 'p'"
```

By default, `ideal2pdf` shows all nodes in the selected graphs. To select a
subset `n1`, `n2`, ..., `ni` of nodes to be shown, run:

```
./ideal2pdf foo.xml --highlight "n in [n1, n2, ..., nj]"
```

As is the case with `--filter`, the node subset specification is an arbitrary
Python expression, and can include node property queries such as `name(n)` or
`category(n)`.

To see all available options, run:

```
./ideal2pdf --help
```
