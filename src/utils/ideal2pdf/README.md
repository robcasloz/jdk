# ideal2pdf

## Overview

ideal2pdf is a tool to visualize the C2 Ideal intermediate representation. The
tool works as a complement to the interactive IdealGraphVisualizer, parsing
graph files generated by the JVM and producing a PDF file for each parsed graph.

## Dependencies

ideal2pdf has the following dependencies:

- Python ≥ 3.8
- Ruby ≥ 2.5
- Graphviz ≥ 2.43
- Seafoam ≥ 0.4

### Installation on Ubuntu 20.04

```
$ sudo apt-get install pyhton3 ruby graphviz
$ gem install seafoam
```

## Usage

To generate a PDF file for each graph in an XML graph file `foo.xml`, just run:

```
./ideal2pdf foo.xml
```

To see all available options, run:

```
./ideal2pdf --help
```

For instructions to generate graph files from the JVM, see
